### CS640 Computer Networks Lab 1

In this exercise, I wrote the code to implement the core logic in an Ethernet learning switch using the Switchyard framework. Besides using Switchyard for developing and testing my switch, I deployed it in Mininet to test it in a "live" setting.

Refer to the [learning switch](https://github.com/jsommers/switchyard/blob/master/examples/exercises/learning_switch/learning_switch.rst) exercise on the switchyard github webpage.
