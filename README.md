The first two assignments will use the [Switchyard](http://cs.colgate.edu/~jsommers/switchyard/) environment, developed by [Joel Sommers](http://cs.colgate.edu/~jsommers/) from Colgate University. 
Switchyard is a Python-based framework for developing and testing network devices such as hubs, switches, routers and firewalls. The objective of these labs is to give you experience with writing the core logic functions for network devices. 
Network devices have "ports"/interfaces that have names. 
The goal of a Switchyard program is

1. receive packet
2. process packet
3. forward packet
